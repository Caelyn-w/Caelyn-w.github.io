									<p>Recent edge detection methods based on deep learning often obtain a probability map of boundary. Each pixel is assigned a gray value to represent the probability that this pixel is on the edge. This kind of probability edge map is difficult to be used directly in image processing applications. Most methods need to use the non-maximum suppression to thinning the edge map to get the binary edge. However, this operation often leads to low-quality edges. Here, we apply our skeletonization method to thinning the probability edge map and get ideal results. Note that a simple step we added is to binarize the obtained probability edge map and calculate the skeleton on it.

									<p>Fig. 2. Comparison of Poisson vector graphics (PVG) generated by our diffusion curves and the manual diffusion curves. (a) Reference, (b) Our diffusion curves, (c) The Poisson vector graphics (PVG) drawn by (b), (d) The manual diffusion curves, (e) The Poisson vector graphics (PVG) drawn by (d).
									</p>

									<p>We also apply the proposed method to the generation of vector graphics. The diffusion curve based methods generate vector graphics by the construction of diffusion curves. However, most of these methods require a large number of user manual interaction to generate the diffusion characteristic curve such as shape boundaries, which also requires users to have the basis of painting and is time-consuming. We use the proposed method to automatically generate the diffusion curves at the boundary position. Specifically, we first use the RCF method [30] to obtain the shapeâ€™s probability edge and binarization, and then use the proposed method to extract the skeleton of the edge region, that is, the corresponding boundary position. Next, we use the color values on both sides of each boundary endpoint to set the color source curve, so as to obtain the final diffusion curves.
									</p>
									<p>As shown in Fig. 19, when we use the manual diffusion curves and diffusion curves obtained by the proposed method, we both generate satisfactory vector graphics. Meanwhile, taking the PVG method [48] as an example, when the user manually designs the diffusion curves, it is necessary to mark the boundary position and set the property of color source curves, which requires at least five user interactions for each boundary curve. But our method can automatically generate the diffusion curve at the boundary position.
